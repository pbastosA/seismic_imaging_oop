## Test and usage of geometry class

### geometryTest.cpp 
    
    - All codes and geometry outputs
    - Point shot and node geometry are tested
    - Line of shots and nodes are tested in both directions x and y
    - Carpet geometry and its reciprocal are tested
    - Circular geometry for shots and nodes are tested 
    - All geometries are exorted on folder outputs 

### verifyGeometryTest.py 
    - Plot of all geometry acquisition
